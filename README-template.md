# User Registration Site

This is a project that demonstrates a user registration site using a modern web development stack. The frontend is created with React, Vite, HTML5, CSS3, and Sass, while the backend API is developed using Node.js, Express, and Prisma, connected to a MongoDB database.

## Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- Register with their first name, last name, email, and password.
- View a card displaying their registration information upon successful submission.
- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
- Receive an error message when the form is submitted if:
  - Any input field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*.
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e., a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*.

## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Next Generation Frontend Tooling
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - JavaScript runtime
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - Web framework for Node.js
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) - Next-generation ORM
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - NoSQL database

### What I Learned

Throughout this project, I gained a deeper understanding of integrating a React frontend with a Node.js backend using Express and Prisma for database management. Here are some specific points:

- How to set up a Vite project with React.
- Implementing form validation and displaying error messages dynamically.
- Connecting a frontend application to a backend API.
- Using Prisma to interact with a MongoDB database.
- Handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript.

### Continued Development

In future projects, I plan to:

- Explore further with more complex state management libraries like Redux or Zustand.
- Implement additional security features, such as password hashing and user authentication.
- Enhance UI/UX with animations and transitions.

### Useful Resources

- [React Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) - Great documentation for getting started with React.
- [Express Documentation](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html) - Comprehensive guide to setting up and using Express.
- [Prisma Documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/) - Useful for understanding how to set up Prisma with different databases.
- [Vite Documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) - Essential for understanding Vite and its configuration.
